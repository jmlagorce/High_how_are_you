Project: High, how are you ?

We built this store front application to to cater to the cannabis stores found in all states that it is now legal in.

Our group was looking into growing industries in our area that would need a secure, friendly and solid digital footprint. While this industry is not just growing in our state but nationaly, yet the digital standard has not been set very high. We see a great opportunity to not only build a site that can handle the traffic driven from upgraded SEO and sales copy would  but simply from the word of mouth from the user experience.  The cannabis industry in Colorado is growing by leaps and bounds each year, in just under 4 years the state grossed just over $500 million dollars in sales tax alone, while not even counting the jobs created. Most recently the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would allow banks to provide services to a cannabis businesses with in states where it is legal. We would like to continue building our app to provide not only smooth UX/UI experience, but a robust stable secure backend that would set the bar even higher in this industry.
